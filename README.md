HI, I'M MORGAN! 👽 (SHE/HER) 
=======================


I am a creative. ✒️ I like to make things.

I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, had an identity crisis because IT helpdesks, database administration, and backend software engineering will never be my shtick, and found myself in a "Baby's First Graphic Design and Digital Marketing" position. Which is great. I learned Adobe CC, photography, and design! I learned how to paint (this is a biggie for me)! I learned what a good website can truly do for a business. 

But, it's been years. I don't remember a whole lot about how to code. So, I'm rectifying that now, and I'm focusing on frontend--> A path I didn't get much experience with back in college, but a path I've learned that I very much enjoy.

🌱 I’m currently learning: React, Figma, Sass, GSAP
