HI, I'M MORGAN! 👽 (SHE/HER) 
----------------------


###### I am a creative. ✒️ I like to make things.

###### I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, had an identity crisis because IT helpdesks, database administration, and backend software engineering will never be my shtick, and found myself in a "Baby's First Graphic Design and Digital Marketing" position. Which is great. I learned Adobe CC, photography, and design! I learned how to paint (this is a biggie for me)! I learned what a good website can truly do for a business. 

###### But, it's been years. I don't remember a whole lot about how to code. So, I'm rectifying that now, and I'm focusing on frontend--> A path I didn't get much experience with back in college, but a path I've learned that I very much enjoy.

###### 🌱 I’m currently learning: React, Figma, Sass, GSAP  

MY ORGANIZATIONS

###### Having a "professional" Github has became a pretty loaded topic, huh?

###### Here's how I treat my Github:
###### It is my coding playground. It is a way to keep track of my progress, thoughts, education, and projects which include challenges, code-alongs, and my own personal work. If I treat my Github as another LinkedIn, that will take all of its magic away from me, y'know? So, I'm not going to do that. I'd prefer to keep my public Github experience fun and focused on self growth.

###### In an effort to stay sane, I have categorized my repos into organizations, treating them as hack-y directories. My own personal work, as of right now, will not be redirected to organizations and will be under the ownership of my personal account.
