HI, I'M MORGAN! 👽 (SHE/HER) 
----------------------



###### I am a creative. ✒️ I like to make things.

###### 🌱 I’m currently learning: React, Figma, Sass, GSAP  


MY ORGANIZATIONS
---------------


###### Having a "professional" Github has became a pretty loaded topic, huh?

###### Here's how I treat my Github:
###### It is my coding playground. It is a way to keep track of my progress, thoughts, education, and projects which include challenges, code-alongs, and my own personal work. If I treat my Github as another LinkedIn, that will take all of its magic away from me, y'know? So, I'm not going to do that. I'd prefer to keep my public Github experience fun and focused on self growth.

###### In an effort to stay sane, I have categorized my repos into organizations, treating them as hack-y directories. My own personal work, as of right now, will not be redirected to organizations and will be under the ownership of my personal account.
